 _Discovery is the privilege of the child: the child who has no fear of being once again wrong, of looking like an idiot, of not being serious, of not doing things like everyone else_ - **Alexander Grothendieck**

## [](#header-1)Introduction
Hi, I am Jagdeep. I came from a beautiful town named Balasore in Odisha, India. I work as a Machine Learning Scientist at the India Machine Learning team (headed by Dr. Rajeev Rastogi) at Amazon. 

In my previous incarnations I was a Masters (Research) student at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof Chiranjib Bhattacharyya](http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/%7Echiru/). At IISc, I got opportunity to collaborate with [Prof Ravi Kannan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindran_Kannan) and [Dr Navin Goyal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/navingo/) while working on developing provable algorithms for Non-negative matrix factorization.

In my free time, I like to watch movies about real/fiction personalities. Some of my favorite movies include To Kill a mocking Bird, Forrest Gump, Bicycle Thieves, Life is Beautiful, The Guide etc. I also try to write critical reviews about movies. 
I like to read short stories e.g. Malgudi days by R. K. Narayan, Rebati by Fakir Mohan Senapati etc. I love to travel to scenic beauties.

Contact me to say "Hi" or to work at Amazon on ML space, Engineer/Scientist (Yes, we are hiring! ). Best way to contact me is by sending a mail to pani.jagdeep at gmail.com or pjagdeep at amazon.com. I can also be reached via [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/jagdeep-pani-b3941a92).
